Codefresh facilitates everything that is related to restoring the best suited image back to the Docker daemon as part of the build step. 
This ensures that your build will be able to run as fast as possible.

Sometimes there might be reasons to wanting to disable this ability.
Codefresh provides two different options to do this.

{:start="1"}
1. Configure a specific build to manually disable the cache only for a single execution

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/921e51a-cache.png" 
url="/images/921e51a-cache.png"
alt="cache.png" 
max-width="40%"
%}

{:start="2"}
2. Pass the no_cache field to the [build step]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/build-1/).
