Many applications require configuration with files, environment variables, command line arguments. It makes applications portable and easy manageable. It's pretty easy to configure application with this way. But it can become very hard to support a tons of config files for different environments and hundreds of microservices. 

Kubernetes provides elegant and very convenient way for applications configuration. This is config maps. You can find more details about it here [https://kubernetes-v1-4.github.io/docs/user-guide/configmap/](https://kubernetes-v1-4.github.io/docs/user-guide/configmap/){:target="_blank"}. 

You can manage all your cluster configuration using Codefresh. This article will explain you how to do it.

## Watch existing config maps
In order to access the list of existing config maps, open Kubernetes Services page and switch to list view.

Select a namespace and hover mouse pointer on it. Click the gear button which appears at the end of the row. You will see list of all config maps inside this namespace, including date of creation and number of configuration variables inside these maps
