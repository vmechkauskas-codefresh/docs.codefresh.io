Post-step operations are a set of optional predefined processes that can be configured on any step. These operations will be executed once the step has completed.
 
## Result Aware Post-Step Operations
You may execute post-step operations conditionally, based on the outcome of the step itself.

To execute operations only when the step has completed successfully, use `on_success`:
  `on_success`
{% highlight yaml %}
step_name:
  ...
  on_success:
    ...
{% endhighlight %}

To execute operations only when the step has failed, use `on_fail`:
  `on_success`
{% highlight yaml %}
step_name:
  ...
  on_fail:
    ...
{% endhighlight %}

## Result Agnostic Post-Step Operations
You may execute post-step operations regardless of the outcome of the step itself.

To execute operations regardless of the result, use `on_finish`:
  `on_finish`
{% highlight yaml %}
step_name:
  ...
  on_finish:
    ...
{% endhighlight %}
