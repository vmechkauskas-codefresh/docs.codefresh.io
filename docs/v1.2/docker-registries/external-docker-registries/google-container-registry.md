To configure GCR first select **Google Container Registry** from the new registry drop down and then provide the following

{% include image.html lightbox="true" file="https://files.readme.io/220c472-add-gcr-new.png" url="https://files.readme.io/220c472-add-gcr-new.png" alt="Add Google Container Registry" max-width="45%" %}

## Generating a JSON key file
The JSON key file holds your credentials for a given [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts). To generate your key file follow these instructions

1. Go to your [Cloud Platform Console Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Select the project that you're creating credentials for.
3. To set up a new service account, click **Create credentials** and then select Service account key.
4. Choose the service account to use for the key.
5. Choose to download the service account's public/private key as a JSON file.
