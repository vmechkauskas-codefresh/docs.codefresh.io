Codefresh makes sure to automatically refresh the AWS token for you.

##### Note

You need to have an active registry all set up in AWS.<br /><br />
Amazon ECR Push/Pull operations can be provide by two permission options: user-based and resource-based.

{:start="1"}
1. User-based permissions: User account need to apply AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser policy (or custom based on that policy).
More information and examples can be found [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ecr_managed_policies.html)

{:start="2"}
2. For resource-based users require permissions to call ecr:GetAuthorizationToken before they can authenticate to a registry and push or pull any images from any Amazon ECR repository, than you need provide push/pull permissions to specific registry. More information and examples can be found [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/RepositoryPolicies.html){:target="_blank"}.

## Using in Codefresh.yaml (old way)
You can configure your `Codefresh.yaml` file directly by first providing
the following in the **Environment Variables** section of the Pipelines view

* AWS_REGISTRY - the registry url (including the repository name)
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY - your access key id
* AWS_SECRET_KEY - your secret key
* AWS_REGION - the region of your registry

and then you can reference those variables in your file like so

  `Codefresh.yaml`
{% highlight yaml %}
push_to_aws_ecr:
  type: push
  description: Free text description
  candidate: ${{build_step}}
  tag: ${{CF_BRANCH}}
  provider: 'ecr'
  registry: ${{AWS_REGISTRY}}
  accessKeyId: ${{AWS_ACCESS_KEY}}
  secretAccessKey: ${{AWS_SECRET_KEY}}
  region: ${{AWS_REGION}}
{% endhighlight %}
