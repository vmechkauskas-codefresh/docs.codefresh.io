url="/images/ed196d3-codefresh_method_compose.png"
alt="codefresh_method_compose.png" 
max-width="40%"
%}

### 3.1 From file in repo
Start a new composition from a docker compose file in your repository.

{:start="1"}
1. In the search box, type the name of the repository.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/10c1ff7-codefresh_compose_add.png" 
url="/images/10c1ff7-codefresh_compose_add.png"
alt="codefresh_compose_add.png" 
max-width="40%"
%}

{{site.data.callout.callout_info}}
##### Don't see your private repositories?
Try the following:
* Started your free trial, so you can add private repositories.
* If the free trial finished you can upgrade your account or contact us to extend the free trial.
* [Visit our Troubleshooting Center](doc:introduction-3)
{{site.data.callout.end}}

{{site.data.callout.callout_info}}
##### Can't find your repository?
Try the **ADD BY URL** option.
{{site.data.callout.end}}

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/972337d-codefresh_compose_by_url.png" 
url="/images/972337d-codefresh_compose_by_url.png"
alt="codefresh_compose_by_url.png" 
max-width="40%"
%}

{:start="2"}
2. From the drop-down menu, select a branch for the first build.

{:start="3"}
3. Click **NEXT**.

{:start="4"}
4. Enter the path to `docker-compose.yml`
By default, Codefresh searches for your docker-compose.yml at the root level of your repository, by the name *docker-compose.yml*. In case that your docker-compose.yml is in sub-directory, provide the path as well (*./foo/bar/docker-compose.yml*).

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/dce8b4e-codefresh_path_docker_compose.png" 
url="/images/dce8b4e-codefresh_path_docker_compose.png"
alt="codefresh_path_docker_compose.png" 
max-width="40%"
%}

{:start="5"}
5. Click **NEXT**

{{site.data.callout.callout_info}}
We donâ€™t support `build` property of compose. We will replace it with images built by pipeline that automatically created. <br>
Also in case if you have `build` property in your docker-compose.yml will be created a repository with pipeline for step that contains `build` property.
{{site.data.callout.end}}

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/503fa16-codefresh_replace_build.png" 
url="/images/503fa16-codefresh_replace_build.png"
alt="codefresh_replace_build.png" 
max-width="40%"
%}

{:start="6"}
6. Click **CREATE**

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/aae9a21-codefresh_compose_repo_created.png" 
url="/images/aae9a21-codefresh_compose_repo_created.png"
alt="codefresh_compose_repo_created.png" 
max-width="40%"
%}

Now you can choose what to do next: **BUILD IMAGES** or **CONFIGURE COMPOSITION**
In case if you chose **CONFIGURE COMPOSITION** you will see the following screen where you will be able to edit your composition and then launch if all necessary images was created.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/0aa5fba-codefresh_first_composition.png" 
url="/images/0aa5fba-codefresh_first_composition.png"
alt="codefresh_first_composition.png" 
max-width="40%"
%}

In case if you chose **BUILD IMAGES** all pipelines from added repository will be triggered to create a necessary images.

### 3.2 From template
If your repository doesn't include docker-compose.yml, you can use one of our templates to see how it works!

{:start="1"}
1. Choose the template

{:start="2"}
2. Click **CREATE**

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/bb380f7-codefresh_template_composition.png" 
url="/images/bb380f7-codefresh_template_composition.png"
alt="codefresh_template_composition.png" 
max-width="40%"
%}

You will see the editor of composition where you can change something and then launch this composition to see results. 

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/d8c8e2b-codefresh_template_compose_edit.png" 
url="/images/d8c8e2b-codefresh_template_compose_edit.png"
alt="codefresh_template_compose_edit.png" 
max-width="40%"
%}

{{site.data.callout.callout_info}}
Click on the rocket icon to launch this composition.
{{site.data.callout.end}}

### 3.3 Empty composition
If you chose the **Empty composition** you want to create a composition from scratch. You will see the following screen with empty composition. 

{:start="1"}

You can add existing built services, or provide the name for Docker image that will be pulled from Docker registry.

{:start="2"}

%}

{:start="3"}
3. Click the **Save** icon on the upper right corner
